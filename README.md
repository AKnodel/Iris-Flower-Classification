# Iris Flowers Classification using Neural Networks

This project aims to predict the different species of Iris flowers based on the length of their petals and sepals. We will be using a neural network implemented in TensorFlow for this classification task. Additionally, we will use various Python libraries such as matplotlib, scikit-learn, numpy, and pandas to help visualize the raw data and final results.

## Technologies Used

- TensorFlow: We will use TensorFlow, an open-source deep learning library, to build and train our neural network for flower classification.

## Python Libraries

- matplotlib: Matplotlib will be used to create visualizations of the raw data and the final results, making it easier to understand the patterns in the dataset.

- scikit-learn: Scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library, will assist us in preprocessing the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and evaluating the performance of our model.

- numpy: NumPy will be used for numerical operations and handling arrays, enabling efficient computation.

- pandas: We will use pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing, as well as reading the dataset from the CSV file.

## Project Structure

```
- data/
  - IRIS.csv
  - output.png
- ml_model.ipynb
- README.md
```

## Data

The dataset (IRIS.csv) is located inside the "data" folder. It contains measurements of petal and sepal lengths of different iris flowers, along with their corresponding species labels.
(the dataset is obtained from *kaggle.com*)

## Visualization

The output.png file, also located in the "data" folder, contains a plotted visualization of the input data. This visualization will help us understand the distribution of the different iris species based on the length of their petals and sepals.

## Jupyter Notebook

The ml_model.ipynb Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code for the entire project. It covers data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualizations.

Feel free to explore the notebook to understand the step-by-step process of the classification task and how we use neural networks to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their petal and sepal lengths.
